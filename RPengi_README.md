# Model Checkpoint

You can find the model's checkpoint in the link to the Peking University cloud drive below. It needs to be placed in the "configs" folder.

# Relavent Datasets

You can find all the datasets involved in the experiment in the link to the Peking University cloud drive below. The compressed file contains a Structure.md file that documents the file structure of all the dataset folders for easy reference.

# Experiment Code

Our experiment code is in the a2tr.py and MC.py files. The a2tr.py file contains code for open-ended tasks and the audio-to-text retrieval task, while the MC.py file includes all the code for multi-class classification (MC) tasks. Both can be run directly.

# Detailed model configuration steps and usage instructions.

Please refer to the README.md file of the original paper in the folder, which contains detailed instructions.
