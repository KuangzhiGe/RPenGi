# üêßPengi: An Audio Language Model for Audio Tasks
[[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11834)] [`Checkpoints`]

Pengi is an Audio Language Model that leverages Transfer Learning by framing all audio tasks as text-generation tasks. It takes as input, an audio recording, and text, and generates free-form text as output. The unified architecture of Pengi enables open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks without any additional fine-tuning or task-specific extensions.
